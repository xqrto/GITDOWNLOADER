The GITinstall.batch file simply goes into a subfolder and the GIP.var file into the folder in which the script is running, i.e. where the starter app is located, which tells the script what to do. As soon as the GITinstall app is called, it will access the GIP.var file if it exists. You can also add your own script to the GITinstall.bat file. The locations for this are marked. If something is used somewhere else, problems can arise. The script is only hidden so that no one can copy it. If someone is worried about a virus, I'm sorry, I can give you the hidden script too, 
but then I just want this script to be inspiring and not copied 1 to 1,
 as it took a bit of work, well, not really, I did it in 20 minutes.
